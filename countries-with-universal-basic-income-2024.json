Surveys indicate the money is spent on (in order of importance) food, school supplies, clothing, and shoes. A second, privately funded pilot project began in Quatinga Velho in 2008. It gives a very small stipend (roughly 5% of minimum salary), and has been cited as improving nutrition, living conditions, housing, and health, especially in children. Finally, the town Santo Antônio do Pinhal uses a legitimate UBI program that splits 6% of city tax revenue among all residents who have lived there for at least 5 years."
